# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Project Scope
The Alphabet Soup Foundation is looking to modernize their  practices with the development of a predictive model to assess an applicant's success.  Upper leadership has become interested in Deep Learning Modeling.  Output from this model is a success predictor to be utized in the decision making process.

Python's TensorFlow library will be utilized to create, train, and evaluate data gathered from previous loans.

## Results

- The variable "IS_SUCCESSFUL" is the target utilized for this model.
- Features considered in the model are"APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", and "ASK_AMT".
- Categorical columns "EIN" and "NAME" were removed from the dataset.  These values were not considered features or targets for the analysis.
